## Mar 16, 2026 — Issue #1449: Anti-Double-Mining Implementation

**Problem**: A single physical machine could run multiple miner instances with different `miner_id` values, each earning separate rewards per epoch. This violated the "one CPU = one vote" principle of RIP-200.

**Solution**: Implemented robust anti-double-mining enforcement:

### Machine Identity Keying
- Hardware fingerprint hash combining `device_arch` + stable hardware characteristics
- Uses CPU serial, clock drift, thermal variance, cache timing ratios
- Same physical machine = same identity (even with different miner_ids)
- Different physical machines = different identities (no false positives)

### Ledger-Side Guardrails
- At epoch settlement, group miners by machine identity
- Select one representative miner per machine (highest entropy score)
- Distribute one reward per machine, not per miner_id
- Deterministic selection ensures idempotent re-runs

### Telemetry & Alerts
- Logs WARNING when duplicate machine identities detected
- Emits `METRIC: duplicate_machines_count=N epoch=X` for monitoring
- Records which miners were skipped and their selected representative

### Files Added
- `node/anti_double_mining.py` - Core enforcement logic
- `node/tests/test_anti_double_mining.py` - 19 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- `docs/ISSUE_1449_ANTI_DOUBLE_MINING.md` - Full documentation

### Files Modified
- `node/rewards_implementation_rip200.py` - Integrated anti-double-mining into `settle_epoch_rip200()`

### Test Results
```
19 passed in 0.05s
- Machine identity: 6 tests
- Duplicate detection: 2 tests
- Representative selection: 3 tests
- Reward calculation: 3 tests
- Idempotency: 2 tests
- Edge cases: 3 tests
```

### Behavior
- **Same machine, 3 miners**: Only 1 rewarded (representative with highest entropy)
- **Different machines**: Each rewarded independently
- **Fingerprint failure**: Zero weight, no reward (VM/emulator protection)
- **Idempotent**: Repeated runs produce identical results

**Impact**: Prevents reward manipulation while maintaining fairness for legitimate multi-machine operators.
